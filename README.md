This project is related to a Udacity course: Programming Foundations with Python.

Generally tried to follow the Google Python Style Guide, including its suggestion for classes that [inherit from no other base classes](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Classes).

To run, clone the repository or unzip all files to a local directory. Then in a console run:

'''
python entertainment_center.py
